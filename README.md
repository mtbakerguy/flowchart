Let's generate some flow charts.  These macros help you create flowcharts.  I've implemented the following objects:
* terminal (e.g. Begin/End,Start/Finish)
* action
* decision
* inspection
* input/output
* delay
* document
* db

There are also two macros that help you connect objects together:
* connect -- arrow between two objects
* raconnect -- an right-angled arrow between two objects

Currently, none of the objects are resizable as my current needs are met by the default sizes.  Likewise, I've left defaults for line/shape attributes as well.
